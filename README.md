# Go
Fun with Go!

Best place to start:
https://tour.golang.org/welcome/1

Other online resources I have referred to for deeper dive:
  Youtube channel from jakewright.
  and exercises from https://gophercises.com/
  
You will see that those develish pointers are back!!! dont worry memory management is taken care.

Concurrency is nicely done here. I have put up a folder with demo examples from official golang tour and have added some 
comments and printf statements for better understanding channel buffers. Try playing with channels to understand what can cause deadlocks.
